1580,"Amidst the death and destruction Hurricane Katrina wrought on New Orleans in August 2005 — including thousands and thousands of residents’ losing or being displaced from their homes, their jobs, and their families — the travails of a professional football team are decidedly minor in comparison. But the damage to New Orleans’ infrastructure and the use of the Louisiana Superdome as an emergency refuge for Katrina victims also displaced the city’s NFL franchise, the New Orleans Saints, forcing them to become vagabonds for the entire 2005 football season. The Saints moved their practice facilities to San Antonio, Texas; played their first “home” game in the stadium of their opponents, the New York Giants; then split their remaining home dates between San Antonio’s Alamodome and Baton Rouge’s Tiger Stadium (the home field of Louisiana State University’s football team). Not surprisingly, given the circumstances, the Saints lost 11 of their last 12 games and finished the season with a dismal 3-13 record, second-worst in the NFL.",NULL,[],https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bears-finishing-katrina-started/,2010-06-15T22:34:22+00:00

1643,"A decades old, popular tale, “The Baby Train” is based on the same premise as the claim that a baby boom occurred after the 1965 New York City blackout: when the usual patterns of home life are disrupted, adults will spontaneously turn to sex as a form of entertainment or solace, without regard for family planning or birth control. Or, as J. Richard Udry wrote, “[i]t is evidently pleasing to many people to fantasy that when people are trapped by some immobilizing event which deprives them of their usual activities, most will turn to copulation”:",NULL,[],https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-baby-train/,2009-07-12T20:22:02+00:00
