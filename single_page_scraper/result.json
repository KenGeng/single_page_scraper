But the damage to New Orleans’ infrastructure and the use of the Louisiana Superdome as an emergency refuge for Katrina victims also displaced the city’s NFL franchise, the New Orleans Saints, forcing them to become vagabonds for the entire 2005 football season. The Saints moved their practice facilities to San Antonio, Texas; played their first “home” game in the stadium of their opponents, the New York Giants; then split their remaining home dates between San Antonio’s Alamodome and Baton Rouge’s Tiger Stadium (the home field of Louisiana State University’s football team). Not surprisingly, given the circumstances, the Saints lost 11 of their last 12 games and finished the season with a dismal 3-13 record, second-worst in the NFL.", "rating": "NULL", "image_url": [], "permalink": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bears-finishing-katrina-started/", "publish_date": "2010-06-15T22:34:22+00:00"}
